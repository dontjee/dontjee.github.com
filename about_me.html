<h2>About me</h2>
<div class="content">
  <p>
  My name is Evan and I follow Jesus. I am a Software Engineer working for <a href="http://www.faithlife.com" target="_blank">Faithlife</a>, and I live in Michigan with my beautiful wife Haley and our family.
  I graduated from Michigan State University (Go Green!) where I earned my bachelors degree in Computer Science. From there I went to work at TechSmith on a variety of applications including <a href="http://www.screencast.com" target="_blank">Screencast.com</a> and <a href="https://www.techsmith.com/tutorial-knowmia-welcome.html" target="_blank">Knowmia</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
  At my day job I primarily program in C# and JavaScript building ASP.Net, React and Node.JS applications for Faithlife.com and Faithlife TV. In my free time I work on a Ruby on Rails <a href="https://wodlogapp.com/" target="_blank">app for tracking Crossfit workouts</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
  Outside of programming I really enjoy <a href="https://crossfitlinchpin.com" target="_blank">Crossfit Linchpin workouts</a>, playing golf and watching Michigan State sports, especially football and basketball (Izzone alum '10).
