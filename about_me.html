<h2>About me</h2>
<div class="content">
  <p>
  My name is Evan and I follow Jesus. I am a Software Engineer working for <a href="http://www.techsmith.com" target="_blank">TechSmith</a>, and I live in squeaky clean Bath, Michigan.
  I grew up in the area, and attended college at Michigan State (Go Green!) where I earned my bachelors degree in Computer Science.
  </p>
  <p>
  At my day job I primarily program in C# and ASP.Net. In the past I worked on <a href="http://www.screencast.com" target="_blank">Screencast.com</a>. Currently I'm working on creating backend services to connect many of TechSmith's existing applications together. In my free time I've been working with Ruby and Rails, and created a website for recording <a href="http://crossfit.com" target="_blank">Crossfit</a> workouts found at <a href="http://simple-dusk-3760.heroku.com/" target="_blank">http://simple-dusk-3760.heroku.com/</a>. I've also been dabbling with Node.js lately.
  </p>

  <p>
  Outside of programming I really enjoy <a href="http://crossfit.com" target="_blank">Crossfit</a> and watching Michigan State sports. Especially football and basketball (Izzone alum '10)
