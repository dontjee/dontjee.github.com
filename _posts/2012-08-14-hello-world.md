#####The catalyst
This past week I had the opportunity to attend [That Conference](http://www.thatconference.com/). It was a great event, and I highly recommend it. One of the keynote speakers was Scott Hanselman and during his talk he made the statment that "**Every developer should have a blog**". I've heard it before but this time it resonated with me.

Rather than continuing to make excuses (no time, no ideas, will anybody listen?), I decided to do something about it. I set a goal to create my blog before the conference was over. It's still a work in progress but I met my goal and the blog lives!

#####My reasons
I'm blogging partly because I've heard smart people say I should, but it's more than that. I have all sorts of places that I keep information about what I'm working on or what I'm learning. I hope that that this blog becomes my defacto place to store information and that I can use it as a reference event if nobody else does.

Additionally, keeping all that I'm learning to myself is selfish. Hanselman calls this multiplying keystrokes. Rather than writing things down for myself in Evernote, I'll share instead, so that others can benefit as well.

#####Wrap it up
That's enough introspection for now. Now it's time for my own call to action for you the reader.

If you're a developer (or heck, anybody moderately technically savvy), **start a blog**! Share what you have to say, and **multiply your keystrokes** so that you reach as many people as possible.
