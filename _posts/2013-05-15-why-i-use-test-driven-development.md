Occasionally I am asked why 


* Guides decisions and helps to develop sufficiently architected code.
* Encourages decoupled code - sometimes hard to name pieces
* Forces you to understand what you're doing before doing it - "tracer bullets" to figure out what you're doing
* Test in isolation. less time in debugger == quicker development
* Gives some level of confidence that new changes have not broken system

Must be coupled with full system tests to verify things actually *work*

Biggest problem for me is the Refactor step. I often skip or make lame attempts at the refactoring
